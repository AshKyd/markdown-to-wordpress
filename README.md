# Markdown to Wordpress XML

Convert a folder of markdown files (in Jekyll/hexo/eleventy style) to a
Wordpress XML import file.

⚠⚠⚠ This is not ready ⚠⚠⚠

There's some users & urls hard-coded in the XML that's specific to my use case.
You can use it as-is and adit the output by hand, or submit a PR to make it more
generic.

Good luck!

```
node index.js --input /path/to/markdowns
```
